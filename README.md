# Reflexive Parsing and Unparsing for C# Objects

This library allows automatic parsing of text into C# objects and unparsing back into text. It has a number of applications including data transformation and implementing experimental programming languages.

The example program shows how it can be used to 
1. Parse and unparse a simple tree structure. 
2. Parse, unparse and evaluate a complex expression. 
1. Parse text representing an EBNF grammar and unparse it back into a fully formatted text.

The example solution contains both the example project and the parsable library project. The latter can be compiled into a standalone component for use with other projects.

The User Manual PDF document should provide enough information to get started using the library.

The Implementation Notes (comments) document provides details of the internal implementation of the library.
